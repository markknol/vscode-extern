	/**
	* Namespace for dealing with commands. In short, a command is a function with a
	* unique identifier. The function is sometimes also called _command handler_.
	*
	* Commands can be added to the editor using the [registerCommand](#commands.registerCommand)
	* and [registerTextEditorCommand](#commands.registerTextEditorCommand) functions. Commands
	* can be executed [manually](#commands.executeCommand) or from a UI gesture. Those are:
	*
	* * palette - Use the `commands`-section in `package.json` to make a command show in
	* the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_command-palette).
	* * keybinding - Use the `keybindings`-section in `package.json` to enable
	* [keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings#_customizing-shortcuts)
	* for your extension.
	*
	* Commands from other extensions and from the editor itself are accessible to an extension. However,
	* when invoking an editor command not all argument types are supported.
	*
	* This is a sample that registers a command handler and adds an entry for that command to the palette. First
	* register a command handler with the identfier `extension.sayHello`.
	* ```javascript
	* commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', () => {
	* 	window.showInformationMessage('Hello World!');
	* });
	* ```
	* Second, bind the command identfier to a title under which it will show in the palette (`package.json`).
	* ```json
	* {
	* "contributes": {
	* 	"commands": [{
	* 		"command": "extension.sayHello",
	* 		"title": "Hello World"
	* 	}]
	* }

	* events and for [finding](#workspace.findFiles) files. Both perform well and run _outside_
	* the editor-process so that they should be always used instead of nodejs-equivalents.

	/**
	 * Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),
	 * like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.
	 *
	 * Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
	 * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	 * programming languages.
	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	 * that can be called with a [TextDocument](#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	 * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	 * 	provideHover(document, position, token) {
	 * 		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Registration is done using a [document selector](#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	 * a more complex [filter](#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	 * a selector will result in a [score](#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](#languages.registerHoverProvider),
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
	 * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

	/**
	 * Namespace for dealing with installed extensions. Extensions are represented
	 * by an [extension](#Extension)-interface which allows to reflect on them.
	 *
	 * Extension writers can provide APIs to other extensions by returning their API public
	 * surface from the `activate`-call.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
	 * 	let api = {

	 * 		}
	 * 	};
	 * 	// 'export' public api-surface
	 *	return api;
	 * }
	 * ```
	 *
	 * When depending on the API of another extension add an `extensionDependency`-entry
	 * to `package.json`, and use the [getExtension](#extensions.getExtension)-function
	 * and the [exports](#Extension.exports)-property, like below:
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * let mathExt = extensions.getExtension('genius.math');
	 * let importedApi = mathExt.exports;
